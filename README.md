I'm sorry I start this task from the last three days.
Actually I choose a lot of courses that I think are useful for my future development, these courses are both on school or online, 
covering computer related topics such as CV, NLP, and also other topics including design and marketing. 
So I usually canâ€™t take part in the experimental class on Tuesday.

But at the beginning, I have read the introduction and found that the content didn't look very difficult, 
so I was very relieved to finish it at the end.
But it turns out that the whole process, especially debugging, 
still took me nearly twice time as long as expected. 
Sometimes in order to find out the problem, I have to check the commit history against low-level errors line by line after submitting to github.


Considering that you said that you don't want us to submit it in a few days, 
and because most of the architecture and code are shown in the book, 
I worry that the teacher might wrongly lowered my score for the sake of it looks like there is lot of code similar among everyone.  
(Of course, I know that many people are partly indeed plagiarism ahhhh)

Therefore, a flash idea into my mind last night so I try to use the mobile phone's time-lapse photography function 
to record almost all of my process, and it was also a good memorial.

By the way, Because of time limitation, I did not use final cut pro or PR to do a lot of post-processing, 
nor did I add subtitles and audio tracks
